# Task Report

Script to print a daily work report, using daily work notes.

## Datasource
Every day I log in notes the ticket I'm working on and the previous ticket to report on the team's daily.
At the moment, the note is created manually on a daily basis.
The structure of the note is:
```
Daily:
	* MBM-1234 Tarea de ayer [x]
Today:
	* MBM-1235 Nueva tarea []
```
